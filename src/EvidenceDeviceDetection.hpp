		 * Device detection specific evidence class containing evidence to be
		 * processed by a device detection engine.
		 * This wraps a dynamically generated C evidence structure.
		 *
		 * The class extends the EvidenceBase class to implement the
		 * EvidenceBase::isRelevant method to return for device detection
		 * specific evidence keys.
		 *
		 * ## Usage Example
		 *
		 * ```
		 * using namespace FiftyoneDegrees::DeviceDetection;
		 * EngineDeviceDetection *engine;
		 *
		 * // Construct a new evidence instance
		 * EvidenceDeviceDetection *evidence = new EvidenceDeviceDetection();
		 *
		 * // Add an item of evidence
		 * evidence->operator[]("evidence key") = "evidence value";
		 *
		 * // Give the evidence to an engine for processing
		 * ResultsDeviceDetection *results = engine->processDeviceDetection(
		 *     evidence);
		 *
		 * // Do something with the results (and delete them once finished)
		 * // ...
		 *
		 * // Delete the evidence
		 * delete evidence;
		 * ```
