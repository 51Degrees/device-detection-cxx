// CityHash, by Geoff Pike and Jyrki Alakuijala
//
// This file provides a few functions for hashing strings. On x86-64
// hardware in 2011, CityHash64() is faster than other high-quality
// hash functions, such as Murmur.  This is largely due to higher
// instruction-level parallelism.  CityHash64() and CityHash128() also perform
// well on hash-quality tests.
//
// CityHash128() is optimized for relatively long strings and returns
// a 128-bit hash.  For strings more than about 2000 bytes it can be
// faster than CityHash64().
//
// Functions in the CityHash family are not suitable for cryptography.
//
// WARNING: This code has not been tested on big-endian platforms!
// It is known to work well on little-endian platforms that have a small penalty
// for unaligned reads, such as current Intel and AMD moderate-to-high-end CPUs.
//
// By the way, for some hash functions, given strings a and b, the hash
// of a+b is easily derived from the hashes of a and b.  This property
// doesn't hold for any hash functions in this file.
