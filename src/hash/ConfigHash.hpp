			 * C++ class wrapper for the #fiftyoneDegreesConfigHash

			 *
			 * // Construct a new configuration
			 * ConfigHash *config = new ConfigHash();
			 *
			 * // Configure the engine to load the entire data set into memory
			 * // for maximum performance, and set the maximum drift and
			 * // difference to allow when finding substring hashes
			 * config->setMaxPerformance();
			 * config->setDrift(2);
			 * config->setDifference(10);
			 *
			 * // Use the configuration when constructing an engine
