/**
 * @ingroup FiftyOneDegreesHash
 * @defgroup FiftyOneDegreesGraph Graph
 *
 * Acyclic graph structures used in the Hash API.
 *
 * Each graph node consists of:
 * - a range of character positions which its hash values are expected to be
 * found, 
 * - the number of characters which should be hashed,
 * - the number of hash values contained in the node,
 * - the modulo used to get the index of hashes in the node,
 * - the hash values themselves,
 * - the offset to the next node in the graph if no hashes match.
 *
 * A matching hash can be found within a node using the
 * fiftyoneDegreesGraphGetMatchingHashFromNode method. If this returns a
 * pointer to a hash, then the node at the offset contained in the hash is used
 * to get the next node to evaluate. If NULL is returned instead, then the node
 * at the 'unmatched' offset should be used to get the next node to evaluate.
 *
 * For example:
 * ```
 * // Declarations (not set in this example block).
 * fiftyoneDegreesCollection *nodes;
 * fiftyoneDegreesGraphNode *node;
 * uint32_t hashCode;
 * fiftyoneDegreesGraphNodeHash *matchingHash;
 * fiftyoneDegreesException *exception;
 * fiftyoneDegreesCollectionItem item;
 *
 * // Get a matching hash from the node.
 * matchingHash = fiftyoneDegreesGraphGetMatchingHashFromNode(node, hashCode);
 * if (matchingHash != NULL) {
 *     // There was a matching hash, so go to the node it points to.
 *     node = fiftyoneDegreesGraphGetNode(
 *         nodes,
 *         matchingHash->nodeOffset,
 *         &item,
 *         exception);
 * }
 * else {
 *     // There was no matching hash, so go to the unmatched node.
 *     node = fiftyoneDegreesGraphGetNode(
 *         nodes,
 *         node->unmatchedNodeOffset,
 *         &item,
 *         exception);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * A leaf node is indicated by a negative value for the node offset (either in
 * the unmatched node offset, or the matched hash). Instead of an explicit
 * leaf node to terminate the graph, this negative value is used in order to
 * save 4 bytes per node, and whole node per leaf of the graph.
 *
 * Once a leaf node is reached, the offset can be negated an used to retrieve
 * whatever type of value the graph was built to store. Usually, this is an
 * offset or index to an element in a collection.
 *
 * **NOTE:** By convention, a node offset of zero also indicates a leaf node.
 * This is permitted by ensuring the first node in a collection (the only node
 * with an offset of 0) is a root node i.e. no other nodes will point to it by
 * its offset.
 *
 * ```
 * // Declaration (not set in this example).
 * fiftyoneDegreesHashNodeHash *hash;
 * 
 * if (hash->nodeOffset <= 0) {
 *     // The offset is negative (or zero) indicating a leaf has been reached,
 *     // so get the value.
 *     uint32_t value = -hash->nodeOffset;
 *     ...
 * }
 * ```
