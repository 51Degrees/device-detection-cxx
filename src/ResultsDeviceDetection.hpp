		 * Encapsulates the results of a device detection engine's processing.
		 * The class is constructed using an instance of a C
		 * #fiftyoneDegreesResultsDeviceDetection structure which are then
		 * referenced to return associated values and metrics. Any memory used
		 * by the results is freed by the extending class.
		 *
		 * Additional get methods are included on top of the base methods to
		 * return device detection specific metrics.
		 *
		 * Results instances should only be created by an Engine.
		 *
		 * The key used to get the value for a property can be either the name

		 * ## Usage Example
		 *
		 * ```
		 * using namespace FiftyoneDegrees::DeviceDetection;
		 * ResultsDeviceDetection *results;
		 *
		 * // Iterate over all User-Agent indexes
		 * for (int i = 0; i < results->getUserAgents(); i++) {
		 *
		 *     // Get the matched substrings of the User-Agent
		 *     string matchedUserAgent = results->getUserAgent(i);
		 *
		 *     // Do something with the string
		 *     // ...
		 * }
		 *
		 * // Get the device id for the device
		 * string deviceId = results->getDeviceId();
		 *
		 * // Delete the results
		 * delete results;
