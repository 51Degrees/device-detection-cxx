		 * Encapsulates the device detection engine class to be extended by
		 * device detection engine implementations.
		 * Device detection specific logic is contained in this class to be
		 * used by any extending classes.
		 *
		 * An engine is constructed with a configuration, then used to process
		 * evidence in order to return a set of results. It also exposes
		 * methods to refresh the data using a new data set, and get properties
		 * relating to the data set being used by the engine.
		 *
		 * ## Usage Example
		 *
		 * ```
		 * using namespace FiftyoneDegrees::Common;
		 * using namespace FiftyoneDegrees::DeviceDetection;
		 * ConfigDeviceDetection *config;
		 * RequiredPropertiesConfig *properties;
		 * EvidenceDeviceDetection *evidence;
		 *
		 * // Construct the engine
		 * EngineDeviceDetection *engine = new EngineDeviceDetection(
		 *     config,
		 *     properties);
		 *
		 * // Process some evidence
		 * ResultsDeviceDetection *results = engine->processDeviceDetection(
		 *     evidence);
		 *
		 * // Or just process a single User-Agent string
		 * ResultsDeviceDetection *results = engine->processDeviceDetection(
		 *     "some User-Agent");
		 *
		 * // Do something with the results
		 * // ...
		 *
		 * // Delete the results and the engine
		 * delete results;
		 * delete engine;
