/**
@example Hash/ReloadFromMemory.cpp
Reload from file example of using 51Degrees device detection.

This example shows how to:

1. Only maintain a reference to a single EngineHash instance and use the
reference to process data.

2. Use the EngineHash->refreshData() function to reload the dataset from the
data file that has been read into a continuous memory space.

3. Retrieve a results instance from the engine and release it when done with
detecting current User-Agent.
	
4. Use the reload functionality in a single threaded environment.

5. Use the reload functionality in a multi threaded environment.

This example illustrates how to use a single reference to the engine to use
device detection and invoke the reload functionality instead of maintaining a
reference to the dataset directly.

The EngineHash->refreshData() function requires an existing resource with
initialized dataset. Function reloads the dataset from the provided pointer to
the continuous memory space containing the data file. New dataset is created
with the same parameters as the original dataset.
	
Please keep in mind that even if the current dataset was constructed with
all available properties this does not guarantee that the new dataset will
be initialized with the same set of properties. If the new data file
contains properties that were not part of the original data file, the new
extra property(ies) will not be initialized. If the new data file does not
contain one or more property that were previously available, then these
property(ies) will not be initialized.

Each successful data file reload should be accompanied by the integrity
check to verify that the properties you want have indeed been loaded. This
can be achieved by simply comparing the number of properties before and
after the reload as the number can not go up but it can go down.

The reload functionality works both with the single threaded as well as the
multi threaded modes. To try the reload functionality in single threaded
mode build with FIFTYONE_DEGREES_NO_THREADING defined. Or build without
FIFTYONE_DEGREES_NO_THREADING for multi threaded example.

In a single threaded environment the reload function is executed as part of
the normal flow of the program execution and will prevent any other actions
until the reload is complete. The reload itself takes less than half a
second even for Enterprise dataset. For more information see:
